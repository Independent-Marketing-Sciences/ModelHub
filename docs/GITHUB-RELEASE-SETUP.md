# GitHub Releases Setup Guide

## üéØ Quick Start: Deploy v1.0.0 to GitHub Releases

Your app is now configured to publish to:
**https://github.com/Independent-Marketing-Sciences/ModelHub**

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

You need a token to allow electron-builder to publish releases.

### Get Your Token:

1. **Go to GitHub Token Settings:**
   https://github.com/settings/tokens

2. **Click "Generate new token (classic)"**

3. **Configure the token:**
   - **Name:** `ModelHub Release Publisher`
   - **Expiration:** `No expiration` (or 1 year if preferred)
   - **Scopes:** Check these boxes:
     - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
       - This includes: repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite, security_events

4. **Click "Generate token"**

5. **Copy the token immediately!** (You won't see it again)
   - It looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

6. **Save it somewhere safe** (password manager, secure note)

---

## Step 2: Set Environment Variable

### Windows (Current Session):
```cmd
set GH_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```

### Windows (Permanent):
```cmd
setx GH_TOKEN "ghp_your_token_here"
```
*Note: Close and reopen your terminal after this*

### PowerShell:
```powershell
$env:GH_TOKEN="ghp_your_token_here"
```

### Verify it's set:
```cmd
echo %GH_TOKEN%
```
Should display your token.

---

## Step 3: Build and Publish v1.0.0

### Option A: Build and Publish in One Command (Recommended)

```bash
npm run electron:build:win -- --publish always
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Build the Next.js frontend
2. ‚úÖ Package the Electron app
3. ‚úÖ Create the installer
4. ‚úÖ Upload to GitHub Releases
5. ‚úÖ Create release with changelog

**Time:** ~10-15 minutes

---

### Option B: Build First, Publish Later

```bash
# Build only (no publish)
npm run electron:build:win

# Then publish manually if build succeeds
npm run electron:build:win -- --publish always
```

---

## Step 4: Verify the Release

1. **Go to your releases page:**
   https://github.com/Independent-Marketing-Sciences/ModelHub/releases

2. **You should see:**
   - Release tagged `v1.0.0`
   - `Modelling.Mate.Setup.1.0.0.exe` (installer file)
   - `latest.yml` (update manifest)

3. **Release will be marked as "Latest"**

---

## Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå Error: "GitHub token is not set"

**Fix:**
```bash
set GH_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
```
Make sure there are no quotes around the token.

---

### ‚ùå Error: "Resource not accessible by integration"

**Fix:**
- Check your token has `repo` scope
- Regenerate token with correct permissions
- Make sure you have write access to the repository

---

### ‚ùå Error: "Cannot find module electron-builder"

**Fix:**
```bash
npm install
```

---

### ‚ùå Build succeeds but doesn't publish

**Check:**
1. GH_TOKEN is set: `echo %GH_TOKEN%`
2. You used `--publish always` flag
3. Token hasn't expired
4. You have push access to the repo

---

### ‚ùå Users not getting auto-updates

**Check:**
1. `latest.yml` is in the GitHub release assets
2. Release is marked as "Latest" (not pre-release)
3. User's app is connected to internet
4. User's firewall allows GitHub access

---

## Publishing Checklist

Before running the publish command:

- [ ] Version updated in package.json (e.g., 1.0.0)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
- [ ] All features tested locally
- [ ] GH_TOKEN environment variable set
- [ ] Git changes committed (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Internet connection active

Then run:
```bash
npm run electron:build:win -- --publish always
```

Wait 10-15 minutes, then check GitHub releases page!

---

## Advanced: Draft Releases

Want to review before publishing?

```bash
# Publish as draft (not visible to users)
npm run electron:build:win -- --publish always

# Then manually edit the release on GitHub:
# - Edit release notes
# - Add screenshots
# - Click "Publish release" when ready
```

---

## Advanced: Pre-releases (Beta versions)

For testing versions:

1. **Use version like:** `1.1.0-beta.1`

2. **In electron-builder.yml:**
   ```yaml
   publish:
     provider: github
     owner: Independent-Marketing-Sciences
     repo: ModelHub
     private: false
     releaseType: prerelease
   ```

3. **Build and publish**

4. **Users won't auto-update to pre-releases** (safe for testing!)

---

## Repository Settings

### Recommended Settings:

1. **Go to repository settings:**
   https://github.com/Independent-Marketing-Sciences/ModelHub/settings

2. **General:**
   - Make sure repository is Public (or Private if preferred)
   - Enable "Issues" for bug reports

3. **Releases:**
   - No special configuration needed
   - electron-builder handles everything

---

## Security Notes

### About the GitHub Token:

- ‚úÖ **Keep it secret!** Don't commit to git
- ‚úÖ Store in environment variable or password manager
- ‚úÖ Only use on your build machine
- ‚úÖ Regenerate if compromised

### About Code Signing:

Currently disabled (`forceCodeSigning: false`). This means:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender might show warning on first install
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Users might need to click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

**Future:** Consider getting code signing certificate for production.
